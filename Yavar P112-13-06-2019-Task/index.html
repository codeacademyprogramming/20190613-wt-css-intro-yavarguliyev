    <p><b>What is Lorem Ipsum? Where does it come from? Why do we use it? Where can I get some?</b></p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lipsum.com"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lipsum.com">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
        comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
        form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lipsum.com">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
        like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
        versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
        like).</blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lipsum.com">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
        slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
        predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of
        over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
        reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
        non-characteristic words etc.</blockquote>
